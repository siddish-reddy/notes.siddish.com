  "One of Shannonâ€™s go-to tricks was to restructure and contrast the problem in
  as many different ways as possible. This could mean exaggerating it,
  minimizing it, changing the words of how it is stated

# Brainstorming Tricks

## 1. A**ttack at each abstraction level in the problem workflow context**

and pick the one with most leverage or with easiest distribution

Example: AI Copilots (Research/Discovery)\
via web app (Elicit)\
via Extension (Memex)\
via Browser (Arc)\
via OS (??)\
via Hardware (Rabbit R1)

## 2. Scaling the problem up and down

from its simplest 1 hour version to one when you have unlimited resources\
from very specific one user level context to full human population

What would be a 10x specialized and focussed solution possibility for this problem?\
and its opposite what would be 10x generalised solution to this

## 3. Put the problem in time travel

Historically were there any similar problems (ofc there will be)? \
and how were they solved\
or how were they attempted to solve but failed

In future, how might this problem be solved 10 years down the line?

## 4. Go from atoms to parallel universes

First principles breakdown

Parallels from other disciplines
