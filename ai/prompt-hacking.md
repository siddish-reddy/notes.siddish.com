<summary>Tic Tac Toe                                                      (Easy, Structured Generation)</summary>

Chatgpt free version itself can play tic tac toe. But prompt the bot that wont lose but Draws or Wins if you make a mistake.

* First move will be from Human.
* Add explainability of why the bot made that move.

R: I bought a green Austin-Healey 3000 last week.
```

```python
Q: Are you going to pick up the blue block?
R: The blue block is sticky
```

```python

R: His daughter has the measles
```

<summary>Solve me today‚Äôs Wordle                               (Instructional, Medium)</summary>

To keep it more challenging try to do with as many less examples as possible or using smaller models than 3.5 turbo

<summary>Don‚Äôt judge me (Big 5 traits)                     (Chain of Thought, Extraction, Domain)</summary>

If we give a dialogue between two persons that is sufficient enough to extract all 5 traits, write a prompt that can map the persons into their respective 3 scale likert Big 5 traits

Example:

John:

Openness: Low

Conscientiousness: High

Extraversion: Neutral

Agreeableness: Low

Neuroticism: Unsure

<summary>Your Design Thinking Intern                        (Domain, Instructional, Chaining )      </summary>

If we give couple user problem statements, like:

```python
Customer 1: The power button on my phone is broken. The warranty is still valid.
Customer 2: My display stopped working.
Customer 3: The customer service rep didn't answer my email.
Customer 4: Every time I call customer support I get no answer.
Customer 5: The display screen cracked and it's still under warranty.
Customer 6: My power button fell off the phone. That's ridiculous.
Customer 7: I'm so frustrated with this company.
Customer 8: When I use the power button too much, it stops working.
```

follow design thinking ideas loosely to come up with **a list of solutions** ranked using any product prioritisation framework.

Bonus: Do one day version, one week version and 11 star rating versionn for each problem.
